# Model-Agnositc-Meta-Learning-for-Few-Shot-Image-Classification
This repository demonstrates the application of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) for few-shot image classification, using the MNIST dataset as a simple example. The project showcases how MAML can quickly adapt to new tasks  with limited data, highlighting its potential for real-world scenarios where data is scarce.
